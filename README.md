# More Traders
With this mod, each tick an attempt to spawn a wandering trader will be made around each alive player in the overworld, where in vanilla only one player would be chosen at random.
Via the /moreTraders command, it is also possible to set the percentage of spawn attempts that succeed once a player is chosen (the vanilla value is 10%).
